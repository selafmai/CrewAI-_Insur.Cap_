# CrewAI-_Insur.Cap_
CrewAI AGENTIC Insur.Cap InsurTech Workflow System

Here's a step-by-step guide to deploy the Autonomous InsurTech Agentic Workflow System:

Prepare the environment: First, ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your deployment machine.
Set up a virtual environment:
 python -m venv insurtech_envpython -m venv insurtech_env
source insurtech_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: insurtech_env\Scripts\activate

Clone the repository (if you haven't already):
 git clone https://github.com/your-repo/insurtech-system.gitgit clone https://github.com/your-repo/insurtech-system.git
cd insurtech-system

Install dependencies:
 pip install -r requirements.txtpip install -r requirements.txt

Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:
 GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_keyGOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
CLIMATIQ_API_KEY=your_climatiq_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

Replace your_*_api_key with your actual API keys.

Run database migrations (if applicable): If you're using a database, run migrations to set up the schema:
 python manage.py migratepython manage.py migrate

Test the system: Before deploying, run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:
 python -m unittest discover testspython -m unittest discover tests

Start the application: For development or testing purposes, you can use:
 python main.pypython main.py

This will start the Gradio interface locally.

Deploy to a production environment: For production deployment, you have several options:
a. Deploy to Heroku:

Install the Heroku CLI and log in
Create a new Heroku app: heroku create insurtech-system
Add a Procfile to your project root:
 web: python main.pyweb: python main.py

Deploy your app:
 git push heroku maingit push heroku main

Set environment variables on Heroku:
 heroku config:set GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_keyheroku config:set GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
heroku config:set WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
heroku config:set CLIMATIQ_API_KEY=your_climatiq_api_key
heroku config:set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

b. Deploy to a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure:

Set up a virtual machine or container service
Install Python and required dependencies
Set up environment variables
Use a process manager like PM2 or Supervisor to run the application
Set up a reverse proxy with Nginx or Apache to handle incoming requests
c. Use a Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider like PythonAnywhere:

Upload your code to PythonAnywhere

Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies

Configure environment variables

Set up a web app pointing to your main.py file

Set up monitoring and logging:

Use a service like Sentry or Logstash for error tracking and logging

Set up performance monitoring with tools like New Relic or Datadog

Implement security measures:

Ensure all API keys and sensitive data are stored securely

Set up HTTPS for secure communication

Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities

Create documentation:

Write user documentation explaining how to use the InsurTech system

Create technical documentation for maintenance and future development

Set up a CI/CD pipeline:

Use tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment

Remember to regularly backup your data and have a disaster recovery plan in place.

After deploying, monitor the system closely for any issues and be prepared to make adjustments as needed. It's also a good idea to have a staging environment where you can test changes before deploying to production.
